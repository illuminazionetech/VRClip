## 2025-05-14 - [Accessibility: Semantic Clearing Misuse]
**Learning:** `Modifier.clearAndSetSemantics {}` is frequently used in this project to clean up the UI for screen readers. While appropriate for removing redundant focus on children of a `selectable` or `toggleable` parent, it was incorrectly applied to `IconButton` components that represented separate, distinct actions (like "More Actions" or "Toggle View"). This made these critical buttons completely unreachable via TalkBack.
**Action:** Before applying `clearAndSetSemantics {}`, verify if the element is a child of a component that already handles its state and action. If the element provides a separate action, use `semantics { mergeDescendants = true }` or no semantic modifier at all to ensure it remains accessible.
